# Engineering Decisions

This repository captures engineering judgment and patterns from building and owning **production systems**.

It is not a “best practices” list, an algorithm gallery, or a tutorial collection.

This is where I externalize **hard-earned decisions** and **painful failures** so others can understand how resilient systems are actually built and maintained.

## Contents
