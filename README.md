# Engineering Decisions

This repository documents architectural decisions, failure analysis, and system design patterns learned from building and owning **production software systems**.

It is intentionally text-first.

No demos.  
No frameworks.  
No tutorials.

The goal is to capture **judgment** — not tools.

Most real-world complexity does not come from algorithms.  
It comes from:
- unclear ownership
- brittle boundaries
- bad data
- partial failure
- and decisions made under pressure

This repository exists to make those decisions explicit.

## Contents

- [`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md)  
  Architectural and engineering decisions I default to — and why.

- [`FAILURES.md`](./FAILURES.md)  
  Failures, postmortems, and lessons learned from real systems.

## Who This Is For

This repository is written for:
- CTOs and founders responsible for production systems
- Senior engineers designing long-lived software
- Teams that have already felt the cost of bad early decisions

If you’re looking for:
- “best practices”
- shiny tools
- or perfect architectures

This is not that.

This is about **what holds up under pressure**.
